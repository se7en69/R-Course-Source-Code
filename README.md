# R-Course-Source-Code
Hosting the source code of my R course on GitHub
Welcome to the Bioinformatics-R-Course repository! This repository serves as a central hub for accessing the source code and materials related to the "Bioinformatics and R: Analyzing Biological Data" course.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of bioinformatics and demonstrates how to utilize the R programming language for analyzing and interpreting biological data. The course covers various topics, including working with R packages, differential gene expression analysis using Deseq2, converting gene IDs to gene symbols, visualizing gene expression data with ggplot2, and analyzing scRNA-seq data using the R Seurat pipeline.

In this repository, you will find the complete source code and relevant materials used throughout the course. The code is organized into folders, corresponding to different sections or topics covered in the course. Each folder contains R scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or other relevant files associated with the specific topic. Additionally, datasets and supplementary files used for demonstrations and exercises are included within the respective folders.

Feel free to clone or download the code and materials from this repository to your local machine. You can explore the code, run the scripts, and experiment with the data to reinforce your understanding of bioinformatics concepts and enhance your proficiency in R programming.

We encourage active participation and collaboration within the repository. If you encounter any issues, have questions, or want to suggest improvements, please utilize the repository's issue tracker and discussion forums. Your contributions and feedback are highly appreciated, and they will help us continually refine and enhance the course content.

Thank you for joining us on this bioinformatics and R journey. We hope that the resources provided in this repository will empower you to unlock the potential of biological data analysis and pave the way for exciting discoveries in the realm of genetics and genomics.

Happy coding and exploring!
